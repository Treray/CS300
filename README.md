# CS300 DSA: Analysis and Design 

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that needed to be solved was identifying the appropriate data structure for the projects. The primary project is a user-friendly program that allows users to upload course data. From the menu, users can print courses in alphabetical order and search for courses to view information such as prerequisites.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached this problem by first understanding the requirements and using tools like pseudocode to structure my design. The Big O time complexities of the hash table, binary search tree, and vector data structures provided me with valuable data to analyze their advantages. Understanding data structures is crucial because the program you are developing may require a specific data structure to run optimally.


How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame obstacles by continuously testing my code and considering feedback from previous projects. By consistently testing, I was able to identify issues early on, such as CSV files not loading or the presence of duplicate data that needed to be removed. The feedback from earlier projects helped me enhance my design, implement edge cases, and add more detailed comments to my code to improve readability and maintainability.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work on this project has improved my understanding of data structures as I implemented code based on analyzing requirements. I now have a better understanding that software design is not just about coding; it also involves planning with documentation, pseudocode, runtime analysis, and communication to create the best user experience. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project has evolved the way I implement maintainability, readability, and adaptability in my code. I have designed functions that can be reused and created scalable data structures capable of handling changes or growth in the future. The readability of my code has improved through the use of detailed comments and proper naming conventions. My code is designed to allow for improvements based on feedback.
